 # Fake-And-Real-News-Detection
## Misinformation is one of the biggest issues in today's society and Fake news is a real problem

Dataset used is from Kaggle- 
https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset

## Problem Statement
We have 2 datasets with Real News data and Fake News data. Each dataset has around 22000 articles. As we merge both, we have around 45000 articles of real and fake. The aim is to build a model to correctly predict if a news is real or fake.
